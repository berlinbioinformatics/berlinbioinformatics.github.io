The meeting usually takes place on the last Tuesday of every second month (starting with January), at 18:00 in Berlin Mitte. This is a small website for the meeting for collecting links and slides.\r\n\r\nThere is not much to see here, most content lives in the [wiki](https://github.com/berlinbioinformatics/berlinbioinformatics.github.io/wiki) and communication happens on the [mailing list](https://lists.fu-berlin.de/listinfo/compbio-social).\r\n\r\nPlease subscribe to the mailing list for announcements of the next meeting.",
